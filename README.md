# ML Kit Sample Application
### Introduction
Welcome to the ML Kit Sample Application! This application is designed to showcase the powerful features of Google's ML Kit library. While the project aims to include all features provided by the library, the current focus is on text processing capabilities, including Language Identification, Translation, Smart Reply, and Entity Extraction. Whether you're a developer exploring ML Kit or simply curious about its potential, this sample application will provide you with a hands-on experience to delve into the world of ML Kit.

## ML Kit features

### Text Features
#### Language Identification
The Language Identification feature enables you to identify the language used in a given text. Leveraging ML Kit's advanced language recognition models, this feature accurately detects over 100 different languages. Whether you're building multilingual apps or analyzing text data, language identification provides valuable insights into understanding and processing textual content.

#### Translation 
The Translation feature allows seamless translation of text from one human language to another. With support for 58 popular human languages, ML Kit empowers Android developers to create applications that break down language barriers and foster cross-cultural communication. Whether you're building a language learning app or enabling global collaboration, the translation feature is an essential tool in your Android development toolkit.

#### Smart Reply
The Smart Reply feature enhances user experience by automatically generating short and contextually relevant replies in a conversation. Powered by machine learning algorithms, this feature suggests appropriate responses based on the input message. Currently, the Smart Reply feature is available for English conversations, providing users with quick and convenient reply suggestions in their daily communication.

#### Entity Extraction
The Entity Extraction feature allows you to extract specific information from a block of text. ML Kit's powerful entity recognition models can identify and extract various types of entities, such as addresses, phone numbers, dates and times, flight numbers, ISBN and IBAN book numbers, monetary amounts, tracking numbers, and payment card details. This feature is particularly useful in Android applications that require parsing and understanding structured data from unstructured text sources.
